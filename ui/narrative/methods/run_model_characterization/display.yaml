parameters :
    fbamodel_output_id :
        ui-name : |
            Output model
        short-hint : |
            Name of the model produced by the gapfill analysis.

    fbamodel_id :
        ui-name : |
            Input model
        short-hint : |
            The metabolic model consisting of a genome-wide set of stoichiometric reactions, compounds, and weighted components of the biomass needed for flux balance analysis (FBA).

    metagenome_model_id :
        ui-name : |
            Metagenome model with coverages
        short-hint : |
            If this is a model of a metagenome assembled genome, a model of the metagenome with coverages computed can be supplied to propagate coverage data to this genome

    coverage_propagation :
        ui-name : |
            Coverage propagation method
        short-hint : |
            This drop down enables specification of how coverages will be propageted from the metagenome model to the MAG
