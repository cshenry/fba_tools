description : |
    <p>Comparison of two different metabolic models identifies their core and unique reactions and compounds, along with the gene-protein associations between the two models. When the input models are constructed from different genomes, a Proteome Comparison data object must also be provided as input to map the genes in one model's genome to the genes in the other model's genome. This method produces an output table that lists core reactions, unique reactions, genes, and annotations associated with each biochemical reaction for the two compared metabolic models.</p>
