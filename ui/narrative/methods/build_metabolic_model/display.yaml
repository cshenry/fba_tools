            Models are generated based on a default template model in KBase. Template models capture the necessary biochemical information based on user-defined scope. KBase primarily uses four template models: (i) Gram positive microbe, (ii) Gram negative microbe, (iii) Core pathways microbe, and (iv) Plant. These template models differ from each other by biomass composition and biochemical reaction functional associations.

    <p>A draft metabolic model serves as an advanced starting point for subsequent curation and gapfilling.</p> 
    
    <p>A genome-scale metabolic network of chemical reactions occurring within a living organism is primarily reconstructed from protein functional annotations originally derived from literature and subsequently propagated from genome to genome by sequence similarity. When a genome is functionally annotated, its metabolic genes are mapped onto biochemical reactions. This information is integrated with data on reaction stoichiometry, subcellular localization, biomass composition, estimation of energy requirements (directionality of reactions), and other constraints into a detailed stoichiometric model of metabolism. This model can be subsequently used for detailed analysis of the metabolic potential of the organism using constraint-based modeling approaches such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA).</p>
    
    <p>The model construction methodology in KBase is primarily based on the Model SEED framework (Henry et. al) and the RAST genome annotation pipeline (Overbeek et. al). Biochemistry data used in the model construction pipeline have been gathered from multiple published metabolic models and from public databases such as KEGG, MetaCyc, EcoCyc, Plant BioCyc, Plant Metabolic Networks, and Gramene. Currently, the biochemistry database in KBase includes more than 13,000 biochemical reactions and over 16,000 metabolic compounds. </p>
    
    <p>Once a draft model is generated, model accuracy can be improved by filling gaps in the metabolic network, known as the gapfilling process, and also through manual curation efforts. The gapfilling process (see <a data-method-id=Ògapfill_a_metabolic_modelÓ>Gapfill Metabolic Model</a>) involves adding a minimal number of reactions and compounds to make the biochemical network capable of generating biomass. This "gapfilled" version of the model can be further improved by reconciling phenotypic experimental growth data generated on different media conditions (see <a data-method-id=Òsimulate_growth_on_a_phenotype_setÓ>Simulate Growth on Phenotype Set</a>). The resulting metabolic model could be used to perform Flux Balance Analysis (see <a data-method-id=Òrun_flux_balance_analysisÓ>Run Flux Balance Analysis</a>) on a given media condition, predicting flux distributions for all biochemical reactions in the network.</p>
