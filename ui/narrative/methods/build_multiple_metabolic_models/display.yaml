parameters :
    genome_ids :
        ui-name : |
            Genomes or Genome sets
        short-hint : |
            One or more genomes or genome sets with functional annotations generated by RAST [2].
        placeholder : |
            Genome IDs or Genome sets for modeling

    genome_text :
        ui-name : |
            Genome list
        short-hint : |
            Name of each RAST annotated genome to build a model from, separated by commas.
        placeholder : |
            Genome IDs for modeling

    gapfill_model :
        ui-name : |
            Gapfill model?
        short-hint : |
            Identify the minimal set of biochemical reactions to add to a draft metabolic model to enable it to produce biomass in a specified media.

    media_id :
        ui-name : |
            Gapfilling Media (defaults to complete media)
        short-hint : |
            Media specifies the set of chemical compounds the organisms can use for  growth. If gapfilling is performed, this media is used as the growth condition for gapfilling. If no media is specified, complete media is used. The “Complete” media is an abstraction of what’s available in our biochemistry database. Every compound that can be transported into the extracellular compartment–or, in other words, for which a transport reaction is available–is used in the complete media. This list is built in real-time, meaning that whenever you run flux balance analysis (FBA) with complete media, the available transporters are parsed from the media database–and is therefore not stored permanently in any media object in the workspace.
        placeholder : |
            Growth condition for gapfilling


    custom_bound_list :
        ui-name : |
            Custom flux bounds
        short-hint : |
            Custom bounds on reaction or exchange flux (e.g., 0;rxn00001;5, 0;cpd00001_e0;5).
        placeholder : |
            e.g. 0;rxn00001;5

    template_id :
        ui-name : |
            Template for reconstruction
        short-hint : |
            Models are generated based on a default template model in KBase. Template models capture the necessary biochemical information based on user-defined scope. KBase primarily uses four template models: (i) Gram positive microbe, (ii) Gram negative microbe, and (iii) Core pathways microbe. These template models differ from each other by biomass composition and biochemical reaction functional associations.

    media_supplement_list :
        ui-name : |
            Media supplement
        short-hint : |
            Specify additional compounds to add to media one at a time by using “add another media supplement” button.


    minimum_target_flux :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum reaction flux
        short-hint : |
            The minimum flux that the target reaction will have when the gapfilling is performed.

    <p>The Build Multiple Metabolic Model App was implemented in KBase to enable users to build genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) based on the ModelSEED Pipeline for multiple genomes simultaneously. This overview of the ModelSEED pipeline [1] details the steps for automated reconstruction of GEMs using the Build Metabolic Model App in KBase.</p>

    <p>To use the Build Multiple Metabolic Model App with genomes uploaded into KBase, these genomes must first be annotated or re-annotated using the RAST functional ontology (<a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/RAST_SDK/annotate_contigset/release”>Annotate Microbial Assembly”</a> or <a href="https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/RAST_SDK/reannotate_microbial_genome/release">Annotate Microbial Genome</a>) before users can build a draft metabolic model for an organism. This is necessary because the SEED functional annotations generated by RAST [2] are linked directly to the biochemical reactions in the <a href="https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase/blob/master/Biochemistry/">ModelSEED biochemistry database</a>, which is used by KBase for metabolic modeling.</p>

    <p>Once each genome has been annotated using the RAST functional ontology, they can be fed into the pipeline for preliminary reconstruction, wherein the RAST annotations are used to generate multiple draft metabolic models. Draft metabolic models are comprised of a reaction network complete with gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations, predicted Gibbs free energy of reaction values, and the biomass reaction. The biomass reaction includes non-universal cofactors, lipids, and cell wall components. The biomass reaction is organism-specific, based on a biomass reaction template, which uses the SEED subsystems and RAST functional annotations to assign non-universal (e.g., cofactors, cell wall components) biomass components that represent unique biological functions exhibited by a large set of organisms or specific to a small set of organisms. The biomass templates can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase/tree/master/Templates">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>In order for an organism-specific biomass component to be added to the biomass reaction, its genome must contain the proper subsystems and annotations specified in the template. The GPR associations represent the mapping between the biochemical reactions and the standardized functional roles assigned to genes during the RAST annotation. This mapping allows the pipeline to differentiate between cases where protein products from multiple genes form a complex to catalyze a reaction, and cases where protein products from multiple genes can independently catalyze the same reaction. The draft model includes all reactions associated with one or more enzymes encoded in the genome that are identified in the annotations. Additionally, spontaneous reactions are added during this step.</p>

    <p>Gapfilling is the process by which the App identifies the minimal set of biochemical reactions to add to a draft metabolic model to enable it to produce biomass in a specified media.This step is optional, but it is recommended and runs by default. A radio box in the advanced options of the Build Multiple Metabolic Models App can be unchecked to allow model reconstruction without gapfilling. Gapfilling can be done later if desired. To gapfill the draft metabolic model or to perform additional gapfilling analysis please see the <a href="https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/fba_tools/gapfill_metabolic_model/release">Gapfill Metabolic Model App</a>.</p>

    <p>The quality of each draft metabolic model depends on the completeness of the annotated genomes used for the preliminary reconstruction. Due to the fact that most genomes are not completely annotated, draft metabolic models usually contain gaps preventing the production of some biomass components. In this step, an optimization algorithm identifies the minimal set of reactions that must be added to each model to fill these gaps [3, 4]. The gapfilling algorithm is described in detail in the <a href="https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/fba_tools/gapfill_metabolic_model/release">Gapfill Metabolic Model App page</a>. Reactions to be used by gapfilling are selected from the <a href="https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase/tree/master/Biochemistry">ModelSEED biochemistry database</a>. This curated database contains mass and charge balanced reactions, standardized to aqueous conditions at neutral pH. The ModelSEED reaction database integrates biochemistry contained KEGG, MetaCyc, EcoCyc, Plant Metabolic Networks, and Gramene. This step is conducted to ensure that every model is capable of simulating cell growth.</p>

    <p>Once model reconstruction is complete, the <a href="https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/fba_tools/run_flux_balance_analysis/release">Flux Balance Analysis</a> (FBA) can be applied to assess the capacity of reactions to carry flux and reaction essentiality.<p>
